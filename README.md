# Neuropixels PXI Plugin

![Hardware diagram](Resources/hardware_diagram.png)

This plugin makes it possible to stream Neuropixels data from a PXI-based  acquisition system into the [Open Ephys GUI](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-gui).

## Installation

This plugin is not included by default, but must be added via the GUI's Plugin Installer. To access the Plugin Installer, press **ctrl-P** from inside the GUI. Once the installer is loaded, browse to the "Neuropix-PXI" plugin, and click "Install."

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you will need to close and re-open the GUI before you can use the plugin in a signal chain.
